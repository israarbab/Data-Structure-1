### Asymptotic Analysis for Functions in oneAlgoThreeFaces.py

Based on the code in `oneAlgoThreeFaces.py`, here is the basic asymptotic time complexity analysis for each function, assuming `n` is the input size and focusing on the dominant operations (arithmetic and loops). This analysis considers the number of operations as `n` grows large.

#### fun1(n)
- **Code**: `return n*(n+1)/2`
- **Operations**: A few arithmetic operations (multiplication, addition, division).
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) – Constant time, as the number of operations does not depend on `n`.

#### fun2(n)
- **Code**: A loop that iterates `n` times, performing addition in each iteration.
- **Operations**: The loop runs `n` times, each with constant-time operations.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) – Linear time, proportional to `n`.

#### fun3(n)
- **Code**: Nested loops where the outer loop runs `n` times, and the inner loop runs up to `i` times (where `i` is the outer loop variable).
- **Operations**: Total iterations = sum from i=1 to n of i = n(n+1)/2, which is quadratic.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) – Quadratic time, as the operations grow with the square of `n`.

The print statements at the end compute the functions for `n=4` but do not affect the asymptotic analysis, as they are for demonstration purposes.
